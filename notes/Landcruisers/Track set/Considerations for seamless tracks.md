Seamless tracks will always be difficult in forts due to how the entire tank "chassis" can expand and contract to insane margins (when compared to a real tracked combat vehicle)

A few options are:
### "Track Box" device
An optional cosmetic device that quite literally serves as a place for the tracks to route to and hide the seam

Upsides:

Fully wrapped tracks, never change distance between links, always taut

Downsides: 

The terms "heavy handed" and "arbitrary" come to mind


### Fixed track link count

Basically calculate how many links are needed when placing down the wheels. The gap between the links will expand and contract as required.

Upsides:

Absolutely seamless, nowhere where it'd be bunched up, or obfuscated by a cosmetic device
Could pave the way towards tracks having a more active role in the game. In the case that wheels were to drift significantly apart from each other, the track segments would dislocate from each other, necessitating some kind of physical force to keep everything together

Downsides:

Tracks could become dislocated, or unreasonably bunched up unless physically simulated
Complicated implementation


### Fixed track link count (with thresholds)

Same idea, but with a threshold that adds and removes new links

Upsides:

Seamless, added and removed links could go unnoticed by a player

Downsides:

It could be super obvious when a link is popping out of nowhere



### Verdict

I'm inclined to go with the Fixed track link count. As nothing is set in stone with the rewrite yet, future considerations can still be made. I would love for tracks to have some kind of gameplay feature rather than being entirely cosmetic, and this would almost necessitate it in a creative way.

Perhaps track segments are added at a cost to the player once everything is set and done. Track segments would increase the friction when compared to regular wheels
